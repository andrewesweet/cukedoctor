==== Convert features test output into documentation

==========
Given ::
The following two features: icon:thumbs-up[role="green",title="Passed"] [small right]#(002ms)#
----

Feature: Feature1

  Scenario: Scenario feature 1

    Given scenario step

Feature: Feature2

  Scenario: Scenario feature 2

    Given scenario step

----
When ::
I convert their json test output using cukedoctor converter icon:thumbs-up[role="green",title="Passed"] [small right]#(017ms)#
******

[discrete]
[IMPORTANT]
=======
[discrete]
To generate cucumber .json output files just execute your _BDD_ tests with *json* formatter, example:
[discrete]
[discrete]
[source,java]
----
@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(plugin = {"json:target/cucumber.json"} )
----
[discrete]
NOTE: *plugin* option replaced *format* option which was deprecated in newer cucumber versions.
[discrete]
=======


******

Then ::
I should have awesome living documentation icon:thumbs-up[role="green",title="Passed"] [small right]#(000ms)#

==== Comments enrichment
Asciidoc markup can be used in feature comments. To do so you need to surround asciidoc markup by *curly brackets*;.

==========
Given ::
The following feature with asciidoc markup in comments: icon:thumbs-up[role="green",title="Passed"] [small right]#(000ms)#
----

Feature: Calculator

  Scenario: Adding numbers
   You can *asciidoc markup* in _feature_ #description#.

    NOTE: This is a very important feature!

    #{IMPORTANT: Asciidoc markup inside *steps* must be surrounded by *curly brackets*.}
    Given I have numbers 1 and 2

    # {NOTE: Steps comments are placed *before* each steps so this comment is for the *WHEN* step.}

    When I sum the numbers
    # {* this is a list of itens inside a feature step}
    # {* there is no multiline comment in gherkin}
    # {** second level list item}
    Then I should have 3 as result


----
When ::
I convert enriched feature json output using cukedoctor icon:thumbs-up[role="green",title="Passed"] [small right]#(006ms)#

Cukedoctor is a *Living documentation* tool which integrates Cucumber and Asciidoctor in order to convert your _BDD_ tests results into an awesome documentation.
[discrete]
[discrete]
Here are some design principles:
[discrete]
[discrete]
* Living documentation should be readable and highlight your software features;
[discrete]
** Most bdd tools generate reports and not a truly documentation.
[discrete]
* Cukedoctor *do not* introduce a new API that you need to learn, instead it operates on top of http://www.relishapp.com/cucumber/cucumber/docs/formatters/json-output-formatter[cucumber json output^] files;
[discrete]
** In the 'worst case' to <<Enrich-features,enhance>> your documentation you will need to know a bit of http://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/[asciidoc markup^].


******

NOTE: The introduction file must be named *intro-chapter.adoc* and can be in any package of your application,

[TIP]
====

By default Cukedoctor will look into application folders but you can make Cukedoctor look into external folder by setting the following system property:
[source,java]
----

System.setProperty("INTRO_CHAPTER_DIR","/home/some/external/folder");

Bdd tests results are converted into documentation by Cukedoctor icon:thumbs-up[role="green",title="Passed"] [small right]#(000ms)#
